# Bascat Dart Program

This is a dart program for converting old tokenized .BAS files to plain text.

In other branches of this repository I have console programs to do the same thing in many languages.  If you prefer, get one of those running.

## Note: Decryption

It was possible to save your file encrypted in GW-BASIC, and I found the
decryption
algorithm in the [PC-BASIC](http://sourceforge.net/p/pcbasic/wiki/Home/)
project. So,
I implemented that decryption scheme... however I do not have any
encrypted BAS files
to test it on, so I don't know if it works.

## Referece

The documentation I used for the tokenized file format was
here:
[http://chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html](http://chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html).
