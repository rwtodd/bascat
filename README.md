# BasCat

`bascat` is a program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files in ASCII.
There are actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default tokenized
format, but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the source.

This is a Rust version.  I have implemented the program in many languages before.

## Referece

The documentation I used for the tokenized file format was
here:
[http://chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html](http://chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html).

## Multiple Languages

I've written BasCat in multiple languages as a learning exercise.
