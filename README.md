# bascat
A Golang program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files in ASCII.  There are 
actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default tokenized format, 
but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the source.

This is mostly a toy program that I'm using to help get familiar with
golang, but it might be useful to someone.

## Referece

The documentation I used for the tokenized file format was
here: [http://chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html](http://chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html).
