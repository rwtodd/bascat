.SH NAME
bascat -- decode binary GW\-BASIC files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbascat\fR [\fIfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
bascat reads 
.B ".BAS"
files saved in the default binary format by 
GW-BASIC and BASICA, outputting plain text. This 
allows the code to be studied or ported without 
needing to run the interpreters in a virtual machine.
.PP
The command will run on a single file given on the 
command line, or as a filter if no filename is 
given.

.SH BUGS
The program will attempt to decode an encrypted
file via an algorithm I found in the
.B "PC-BASIC"
project.  However, I don't have any protected
.B ".BAS"
files, so I have not tested that code.
