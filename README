                          ==[ bascat v1.0 ]==

A c (unix) program to decode GW-BASIC/BASICA tokenized files.

There are actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default
tokenized format, but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the
source.  bascat is a program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files
in ASCII.



                      ==[ Building/Installing ]==

This version of bascat uses the UNIX `dc` program to convert the floats
in a way that doesn't depend on the machine's endianness or floating-point
representation.  The location it expects `dc` in is in the `config.h`
file (default: /usr/bin/dc).

Then, I use...

    make check
    make PREFIX=$HOME install

... where PREFIX will default to `/usr` if I didn't specify it.  A man
page is also installed.

                           ==[ Formatting ]==

I use GNU indent:

    indent main.c --no-tabs

It's available in the makefile as `make indent`.
