			     ==[ bascat v1.1 ]==

A c (unix) program to decode GW-BASIC/BASICA tokenized files.

There are many more versions of this program in this repository. Each has its
own branch (scala-version, win32-version, and so forth).


			     ==[ Motivation ]==

There are actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default
tokenized format, but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the source.
bascat is a program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files in ASCII.



			 ==[ Building/Installing ]==

This version of bascat uses the UNIX `dc` program to convert the floats in a
way that doesn't depend on the machine's endianness or floating-point
representation.  The autoconf script searches for it, but you can override
the location if it can't be found automatically for some reason.

It's an autotools project.  Just:

    configure && make && sudo make install

or whatever you like to do.


			     ==[ Formatting ]==

I use GNU indent:

    indent main.c --no-tabs

It's available in the makefile as `make indent`.
