                             ==[ bascat ]==
-------------------------------------

A c (unix) program to decode GW-BASIC/BASICA tokenized files.

There are actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default
tokenized format, but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the
source.  bascat is a program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files in
ASCII.

                      ==[ Building/Installing ]==

I've used GNU autotools for this project, so for most people it is as
simple as:

    ./configure && make && sudo make install 

if you download a distribution package.  If you are checking out the code
from the repository, you'll need to run:

    autoreconf -iv

first to get all the infrastructure in place.

                            ==[ Formatting ]==

I use GNU indent:

    indent main.c --no-tabs
