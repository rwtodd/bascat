			     ==[ bascat v1.2 ]==

A c (unix) program to decode GW-BASIC/BASICA tokenized files.

There are many more versions of this program in this repository. Each has its
own branch (scala-version, win32-version, and so forth).


			     ==[ Motivation ]==

There are actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default
tokenized format, but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the source.
bascat is a program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files in ASCII.



			 ==[ Building/Installing ]==

This version of bascat uses the UNIX `dc` program to convert the floats in a
way that doesn't depend on the machine's endianness or floating-point
representation.  The configure script searches for it, but you can override
the location if it can't be found automatically for some reason.

It's not an autotools project, but the configure script should not
surprise you.  You can still set the --prefix and what-not.  Plus, it's simple
enough that you can easily modify it if you have a strange system.  But for
defaults, just:

    configure && make && sudo make install


			     ==[ Formatting ]==

I use GNU indent:

    indent main.c --no-tabs

It's available in the makefile as `make indent`.
