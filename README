                             ==[ bascat ]==

A c (unix) program to decode GW-BASIC/BASICA tokenized files.

There are actually a fair amount of .BAS files out there in the default
tokenized format, but you'd need a working GWBASIC/BASICA to see the
source.  bascat is a program to print out tokenized gwbasic .BAS files in
ASCII.

                      ==[ Building/Installing ]==

I've used GNU autotools for this project, so for most people it is as
simple as:

    ./configure && make && sudo make install 

... with all the standard options available.
